# phpDoc2pdf

Create PDF formatted documentation for your PHP projects.

phpDoc2pdf uses the [phpDocumentor/Reflection](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/Reflection) library to extract the classes, interfaces and traits from your project and generate a set of documentation similar to the one that [phpDocumentor2](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor2) provides, but in PDF format.

You can see some examples on the [docs](/docs) folder.

## Getting Started
