Create PDF formatted documentation for your PHP projects.

phpDoc2pdf uses the [phpDocumentor/Reflection](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/Reflection) library to extract the classes, interfaces and traits from your project and generate a set of documentation similar to the one that [phpDocumentor2](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor2) provides, but in PDF format.

You can see some examples on the [docs](/docs) folder.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

1. Download the PHAR file directly from [here](https://github.com/lluiscamino/phpDoc2pdf/releases).

### Usage

Use the following command to generate the documentation:

```bash
php phpDoc2pdf.phar create <INPUT> <OUTPUT>
```

Replace ``<INPUT>`` with the PHP file or directory that you want to document and ``<OUTPUT>`` with the directory where the documentation will be saved.

Please note that the files you want to document have to be in UTF-8 format.
